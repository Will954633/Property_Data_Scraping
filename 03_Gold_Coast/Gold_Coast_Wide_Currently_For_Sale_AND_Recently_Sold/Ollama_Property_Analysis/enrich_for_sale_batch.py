Batch Photo & Floor Plan Enrichment — Valuation-Grade Schema (For Sale)
Last Edit: 24/02/2026

Processes all unprocessed documents across all 8 target market suburb collections in
Gold_Coast_Currently_For_Sale. Writes property_valuation_data, floor_plan_analysis,
and processing_status to each document.

These fields are preserved when a property sells and is migrated to Gold_Coast_Recently_Sold
by monitor_sold_properties.py (which copies the entire document).

Features:
  - Skips already-processed documents (processing_status.images_processed = True)
  - Resumes from where it left off if interrupted
  - Retry on transient errors (up to MAX_RETRIES per document)
  - Rate limiting between calls to avoid OpenAI throttling

Run:
    python3 enrich_for_sale_batch.py                        # all 8 target market suburbs
    python3 enrich_for_sale_batch.py --collection robina    # single collection
    python3 enrich_for_sale_batch.py --limit 5              # test run
    python3 enrich_for_sale_batch.py --dry-run              # count only

PHOTO_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a professional property valuer analysing real estate listing photos for use in market comparison valuations (comparable sales analysis). Your output must use EXACT controlled vocabulary so that MongoDB queries can filter and compare properties consistently.

Analyse all provided property photos and return ONLY a valid JSON object matching this structure. Use null for any field not visible or determinable.

CONTROLLED VOCABULARY — use ONLY these exact strings for categorical fields:

building_type: "house" | "duplex" | "townhouse" | "unit"
architectural_style: "contemporary" | "colonial" | "queenslander" | "federation" | "ranch" | "hamptons" | "other"
roof_type: "tile" | "colorbond" | "metal" | "slate" | "flat"
overall_condition: "excellent" | "good" | "fair" | "poor"
cladding_material: "brick" | "render" | "weatherboard" | "fibro" | "composite" | "stone" | "vinyl"
condition (surfaces/paint/tiles/flooring): "new" | "good" | "fair" | "poor"
paint_condition: "new" | "good" | "fair" | "poor" | "peeling"
window_type: "aluminium" | "timber" | "upvc" | "double_glazed"
driveway_type: "concrete" | "pavers" | "gravel" | "asphalt" | "exposed_aggregate" | "none"
garage_type: "none" | "carport" | "single_garage" | "double_garage" | "triple_garage"
  IMPORTANT — garage vs carport distinction:
    "single_garage" / "double_garage" / "triple_garage" = fully ENCLOSED with walls and a door (roller door or panel lift), built-in or attached to the house. Cars are secured inside.
    "carport" = open-sided structure on posts/poles with a roof but NO enclosing walls. Cars are covered but not enclosed.
    "none" = no covered parking at all.
    When in doubt from photos, look for roller/panel lift doors = garage. Open sides with posts = carport.
fence_type: "none" | "timber" | "colorbond" | "brick" | "pool_fence" | "mixed"
benchtop_material: "stone" | "laminate" | "timber" | "concrete" | "corian"

PRESTIGE TIER — classify the overall build quality and design calibre visible in the photos:
  "standard" = Typical suburban home. Builder-grade finishes, standard layouts, basic materials. Brick, tile roof, laminate benchtops, enclosed showers, standard ceiling heights. No standout design intent. This is the vast majority of homes.
  "elevated" = Above-average home with quality upgrades. May have stone benchtops, good fixtures, renovated kitchen/bathroom, or tasteful cosmetic renovation. Still a conventional design — not architect-designed. Quality is above average but the home does not command a premium beyond its physical features.
  "prestige" = Architect-designed or builder-prestige home that is visually in a different class. Indicators: bespoke design elements (feature walls, void spaces, custom joinery, statement lighting), premium material palette throughout (herringbone timber, natural stone, timber cladding), frameless glass, high or raked ceilings, seamless indoor-outdoor design with oversized openings, and a cohesive design language across the whole property. The home looks like it belongs in an architectural or lifestyle magazine. These homes typically sell for 50-100% above median for their suburb.
  "ultra_prestige" = Landmark or trophy home. Multiple signature features: dramatic architectural statement visible from the street, resort-style grounds, bespoke everything, materials and craftsmanship that are clearly in the top 1% (e.g. imported stone, full automation, commercial-grade kitchen). Extremely rare — only 1-2% of properties should receive this rating.

Key distinction: "elevated" is a nice home well-maintained or nicely renovated. "prestige" is a fundamentally different product — the architecture, materials, and design intent place it in a separate market segment where comparable sales from standard homes are irrelevant.

SCORES: All _score fields use integer 1-10:
  10=exceptional/luxury, 8-9=high quality, 6-7=good/well maintained,
  4-5=average/acceptable, 2-3=below average, 1=poor/significant issues

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. FLOOR AREA DISTINCTION — THREE SEPARATE VALUES:
   - internal_floor_area = Living spaces only (bedrooms, living, kitchen, bathrooms, laundry, hallways). Excludes garage, alfresco, porches.
   - total_floor_area = internal PLUS all covered external areas (garage, alfresco, carport, porch, covered deck).
   - external_floor_area = covered external areas only = total minus internal.
     * FIRST: look for an explicit label on the plan such as "External 33.4 m2" or "Covered External" — if found, use it and set source="explicit_label".
     * OTHERWISE: calculate as total_floor_area - internal_floor_area and set source="calculated".
     * If only one of internal or total is shown (not both), set external_floor_area value to null.
   - Look for labels like "Internal Floor Area", "Total Floor Area", "Building Area", "External Area".

2. Extract ALL measurements shown on the floor plan - don't miss any room dimensions

3. Count ALL bedrooms - there is no upper limit, extract however many exist (could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more)

4. For each room, capture:
   - Exact dimensions if shown (length x width)
   - Calculated or stated area
   - All features mentioned (ensuite, robe, island, pantry, etc.)

5. Be thorough - extract every piece of useful information visible
5. If information is not available or unclear, use null and note it in the appropriate field
6. Provide confidence levels honestly based on available information
7. In buyer_insights, think about what makes this property unique and valuable
8. Include all room types, not just bedrooms - living areas, outdoor spaces, storage, etc.
9. For outdoor spaces, include pools, patios, decks, alfresco areas, etc.
10. Note any special features like butler's pantry, study nooks, storage areas, etc.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure."""
